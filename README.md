# 2-axis-robotic-arm

Inspired by the range of open-source 3d-printable robots arms designed by Carlo Franciscone, this 4-axis robot is an alternate version of the EEzybot MK3 powered by stepper motors. The original EEzybot MK3 robot is a scaled down version of the ABB IRB460 robot. 

This alternative version has a new base with a bearing support system while incorporating 3 stepper motors in order to perform basic pick and place operations. 3D printing of the components were performed by the Creality's Ender 3 Pro printer. The STL files and the assembly instruction files are available for download. 

Updates on the electrical and firmware aspect of this robot will be uploaded soon. Stay tuned.
